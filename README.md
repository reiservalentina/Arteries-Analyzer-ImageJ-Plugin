Using the ImageJ software, a freely available new plugin named “Arteries Analyzer/ImageJ” was developed.
The plugin was programmed specifically for this research, in order to enable an automated, objective analysis. The aim of the „Arteries Analyzer“ is to measure the osseous borders of the arterial channels of the phalanx distalis from arcus terminalis to the margo solearis, and to characterize them numerically.
The Plot Profile lists the precise measurements of the arterial channels based on very limited manual input. 
The sequence of processing is as follows:
After starting ImageJ the plugin “Arteries Analyzer” is found under the folder “Plugins” and the subfolder “Analyze”. After launching the “Arteries Analyzer” the radiograph to analyze can be opened by ImageJ.
The plot profile will guide the user through every step of the measurements by showing pop up icons.
Appendix /How to use: 
After scaling using a straight, another straight line was drawn between the lateral and the medial fovea ligamentaria of the phalanx proximalis (b_(proximal pastern), (figure A). 
The next step was to place a transversal (lateromedial) reference line (x) at the level of the coffin joint by connecting the most distal contours of the medial and lateral half of the joint surface within the distal phalanx (figure B).
Figure C shows the first straight line of the first visible arterial channel. This line is drawn manually starting from the visible end of the arterial channel at the margo solearis towards the arcus terminalis. 
Figure D shows the second straight line of the first visible arterial channel and its drawn starting from the visible end of the arteriole at the margo solearis towards the arcus terminalis. These line was drawn as far as the borders of the arteriole were clearly discernible.
Figure E shows the closing line of the visible first arterial channel. This line was created by manually drawing a transversal straight line closing the arterial channel at the point where the borders ended proximally. 
Figure F describes the step where the “Arteries Analyzer” ask the user to choose the left line in the ROI Manager. 
Afterwards the user has to select if another arteriole should be measured (Figure G). 
If no other arteriole should be measured, the user has to decide if a ellipse should be measured (Figure H). 
If yes, the ellipse has to be measured counterclockwise similar to the arterioles by placing and shaping an ellipse congruent to the area of reduced bone density using the shapes selection of imageJ. (Figure I)
