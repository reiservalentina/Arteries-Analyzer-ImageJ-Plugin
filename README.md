Appendix: 
After scaling using a straight, another straight line was drawn between the lateral and the medial fovea ligamentaria of the phalanx proximalis (b_(proximal pastern), (figure A). The next step was to place a transversal (lateromedial) reference line (x) at the level of the coffin joint by connecting the most distal contours of the medial and lateral half of the joint surface within the distal phalanx (figure B).
Figure C shows the first straight line of the first visible arteriole. This line is drawn manually starting from the visible end of the arteriole at the margo solearis towards the arcus terminalis.
Figure D shows the second straight line of the first visible arteriole that is drawn starting from the visible end of the arteriole at the margo solearis towards the arcus terminalis. These line was drawn as far as the borders of the arteriole were clearly discernible. 
Figure E shows the closing line of the visible first arteriole. This line was created by manually drawing a transversal straight line closing the arteriole at the point where the borders indicated by lines d and e ended proximally. 
Figure F describes the step where the “Arteries Analyzed” ask the user to choose the left line in the ROI Manager. 
Afterwards the analyzer has to select if another arteriole should be measured (Figure G).
If no other arteriole should be measured, the analyzer has to decide if a ellipse should be measured (Figure H). 
If yes, the ellipse has to be measured counterclockwise similar to the arterioles by placing and shaping an ellipse congruent to the area of reduced bone density using the shapes selection of imageJ.
